/**
 * Default cluster renderer which shows clusters as markers with specialized icons.
 * There is logic to decide whether to expand a cluster or not depending on the number of
 * items or the zoom level.
 * There is also some performance optimization where only clusters within the visisble
 * region are shown.

/**
 * Animates the clusters to achieve splitting (when zooming in) and merging
 * (when zooming out) effects:
 * - splitting large clusters into smaller ones when zooming in.
 * - merging small clusters into bigger ones when zooming out.
 *
 * NOTES: the position to animate to/from for each cluster is heuristically
 * calculated by finding the first overlapping cluster. This means that:
 * - when zooming in:
 *    if a cluster on a higher zoom level is made from multiple clusters on
 *    a lower zoom level the split will only animate the new cluster from
 *    one of them.
 * - when zooming out:
 *    if a cluster on a higher zoom level is split into multiple parts to join
 *    multiple clusters at a lower zoom level, the merge will only animate
 *    the old cluster into one of them.
 * Because of these limitations, the actual cluster sizes may not add up, for
 * example people may see 3 clusters of size 3, 4, 5 joining to make up a cluster
 * of only 8 for non-hierachical clusters. And vice versa, a cluster of 8 may
 * split into 3 clusters of size 3, 4, 5. For hierarchical clusters, the numbers
 * should add up however.
 *
 * Default to YES.
